## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge tested me particularly in  handling the table at the end. I broke a few rules in fixing that and the punishment is weird looking table in different screen sizes. That is soemthing I'll definitely have to improve on.

### Continued development

Tables and Table styling
